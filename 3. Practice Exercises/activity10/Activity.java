public class Activity {
//    NOTE: DO NOT google solutions. Complete each part on your own.
//
//    In this activity you will find the smallest number in the numbers array.
//    For example,
//    array = [1, 2, 5, 3, 9], smallest number = 1
//    For example,
//    array = [-1, 2, 10, 3, 5], smallest number = -1
//
//    HINT:
//    Use a for loop to loop through the array.
//    Use if statement to compare each number to see which is smallest.
//    You will need to store the smallest number in a variable and then return that.
//
//    Run tests in ActivityTest file. All tests should fail.
//    Complete each method below. After completing it, re-run the tests.
//    If everything was solved correctly, the tests should pass.

//        I have already created this variable for you as starter code.
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

//        Write the rest of the code here

        return min;
