    // This exercise is to determine if a number is Prime or not.
    // What is a Prime number?
    // All numbers that are greater than one and have only two divisors,
    // i.e., one and the number itself, are identified as prime numbers.
    // We can also understand a prime number as a number that has exactly two divisors.
    // For example, letâ€™s take the numbers 2 through 7:
    // Divisors of 2 are 1 and 2
    // Divisors of 3 are 1 and 3
    // Divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4
    // Divisors of 5 are 1 and 5
    // Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6
    // Divisors of 7 are 1 and 7
    // 2, 3, 5, and 7 are numbers that have exactly two divisors,
    // i.e., one and the respective number itself, so they are prime numbers.
    // 4 and 6 are non-prime numbers.

    // NOTE: 0 and 1 are NOT considered prime numbers.

    // Run tests in ActivityTest file. All tests should fail.
    // Complete each method below. After completing it, re-run the tests.
    // If everything was solved correctly, the tests should pass.
    public boolean isPrimeNumber(int number) {
        // TODO 1 - this should return true if the number is Prime, and return false if the number is NOT Prime.
        return false;
