//    NOTE: DO NOT google solutions. Complete each part on your own.
//    In this activiry you will return whether the year is Leap Year or not.
//    If the year is Leap Year, return true.
//    If the year is not Leap Year, return false.
//    A year is called Leap Year based on the following rules:
//    A year is considered Leap Year if it is divisible by 4.
//    Unless the year ends in 00, being a century for example 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100
//    If the year is century (based on above), then it is a Leap Year if it is divisible by 400.
//
//    Run tests in ActivityTest file. All tests should fail.
//    Complete each method below. After completing it, re-run the tests.
//    If everything was solved correctly, the tests should pass.
//
//    HINT:
//    First check if the year is divisible by 4. If it is not then return false and thats it.
//    If the year is divisible by 4, check if it is a century. This can be done by checking if it is divisible by 100.
//    All years ending in 00 will be divisible by 100.
//    If it is determined that the year is century, then check if it is divisible by 400. If it is, then it is a leap
//    year, otherwise return false.
