# Sorting Hat Ceremony Activity
    Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry reached out to bring their Sorting Hat ceremony
    to the digital era. He would like the ceremony to be computerized instead of manual process.

    Sorting Hat is a magical hat that decides which house do the first year students go to. These houses are
    Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.

    Sorting Hat uses student's personality to determine which house the student belongs to.

    You are going to write a program that does the work of Sorting Hat.
